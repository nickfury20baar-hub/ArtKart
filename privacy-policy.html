<p>ArtKart operates the website https://art-kart.netlify.app (the "Site" or "Platform"), an online marketplace dedicated to discovering, buying, and selling original artworks, with a primary focus on Indian artists and collectors.

<section>
    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>3. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>We use cookies, web beacons, pixels, local storage, and similar technologies ("Cookies") to enhance functionality, analyze traffic, and deliver relevant content/ads.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> Required for basic Site functions (navigation, security, form submissions).</li>
        <li><strong>Performance/Analytics Cookies:</strong> Track usage (e.g., Google Analytics) to understand visitor behavior and improve the Site.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="highlight"><strong>Google AdSense Specific Disclosure (Required for Compliance):</strong><br>
    Third-party vendors, <strong>including Google</strong>, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to our Site or other websites on the Internet. Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to you based on your visit to our Site and/or other sites across the Internet. These cookies may track interests, demographics, and online behavior for personalized (interest-based) advertising.</p>

    <p>You can manage or delete cookies through your browser settings. However, disabling essential cookies may limit Site functionality.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>4. Third-Party Advertising and Google AdSense</h2>
    <p>We may display advertisements on the Site, including through Google AdSense (or similar programs). Third-party ad vendors, including Google, use cookies and other technologies to serve ads tailored to your interests.</p>

    <p class="highlight"><strong>Opt-Out Options for Personalized Advertising:</strong><br>
    You may opt out of personalized (interest-based) advertising by:<br>
    • Visiting Google's Ad Settings page: <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/settings/ads</a><br>
    • Using the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out tool: <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a><br>
    • Or visiting other vendor opt-out pages if additional networks are used (we will update this section if applicable).</p>

    <p>Note: Opting out does not stop ads entirely — you may still see generic/contextual ads. For more on Google's practices, see their <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>5. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We share data only:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>With service providers (Netlify for hosting, Google for analytics/ads, payment processors, email services) under strict confidentiality.</li>
        <li>To comply with legal requirements, court orders, or protect rights/safety.</li>
        <li>In business transfers (merger, acquisition) with notice where required.</li>
        <li>With your consent (e.g., sharing artist contact for collaborations).</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical, administrative, and physical safeguards (HTTPS encryption, access controls, regular reviews) to protect your data from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration. However, no system is completely secure — we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>7. Your Privacy Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access, correction, or deletion of your data.</li>
        <li>Opt-out of certain processing (e.g., marketing, personalized ads).</li>
        <li>Withdraw consent where processing is consent-based.</li>
        <li>Non-discrimination for exercising rights (CCPA-style).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise rights, contact us at [your-email@example.com]. We respond to valid requests within applicable timeframes (e.g., 30-45 days). For CCPA/CPRA users: We do not "sell" personal information as defined under California law.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>As an India-based platform, data may be processed in India or other countries (e.g., via Google servers). We ensure appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers where required by law.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Site is not intended for children under 13 (or 16 in some jurisdictions). We do not knowingly collect data from children. If we learn of such collection, we will delete it promptly.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
